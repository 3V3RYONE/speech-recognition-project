- MFCC coefficients contain information about the rate changes in the different spectrum bands.
- pitch, in speech, the relative highness or lowness of a tone as perceived by the ear, which depends on the number of vibrations per second produced by the vocal cords.
- VAD - Voice Activity Detection - Voice activity detection (VAD) is a technique in which the presence or absence of human speech is detected. The detection can be used to trigger a process. VAD has been applied in speech-controlled applications and devices like smartphones, 
- zeroCR - The zero-crossing rate (ZCR) is the rate at which a signal transitions from positive to zero to negative or negative to zero to positive. Its value has been extensively used in both speech recognition and music information retrieval for classifying percussive sounds.
